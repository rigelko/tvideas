In concert the situation is  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a> . Now the price is on the Kijun - which recently went below the Tenkan having lost the  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  move of mid-September in its calculation.

Clear  <a href=\"/ideas/relativestrengthindex/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">RSI</span></a>  divergence. <br/>\r\n2. Fair value gap above. <br/>\r\n3.  <a href=\"/ideas/threedrivespattern/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Three drives</span></a>  pattern has formed. <br/>\r\n4. The stock market is closed. <br/>\r\n5. Low  <a href=\"/ideas/volume/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volume</span></a> , hence, it's easy to manipulate the price. <br/>\r\nOverall, my entry point would be 21 300-21 500, stop loss - 23 000, take profit - 12 500-14 000 (that's where the last unfilled monthly gap and a  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  order block are located).  <br/>\r\nFollow me for more future trade opportunities. <br/>\n</div>", "<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">\n<span class=\"tv-chart-updates__label tv-chart-updates__label--\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComment:\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tStill waiting\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">\n<span class=\"tv-chart-updates__label tv-chart-updates__label--cancelled\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOrder cancelled:\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\\this poi is not valid anymore\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">\n<span class=\"tv-chart-updates__label tv-chart-updates__label--active\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrade active:\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tI was spooked by SPX and thought the price won't reach aforementioned target, but BTC didn't move at all, I think when SPX will make a correction to the upside, BTC will fill the imbalanced region.
