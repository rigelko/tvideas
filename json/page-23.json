So here it is: <br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:SPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-SPY/\"><span>SPY</span> </a></span>  has been hugging its  <a href=\"/ideas/linearregression/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">linear regression</span></a>  line. It really is not moving. Despite the big ups and downs we had these past 2 days, if you look at the chart,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:SPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-SPY/\"><span>SPY</span> </a></span>  and the market as a whole has literally been hugging its mean.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe are now approaching the point where, if  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:SPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-SPY/\"><span>SPY</span> </a></span>  is to remain in this regression channel it has been in since August, our  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  targets are pretty much off the table. As of tomorrow, our weekly and mothly  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  targets will be pretty much outside of the regression trend. They would take  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:SPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-SPY/\"><span>SPY</span> </a></span>  breaking out to the upside from this well asserted channel.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHow likely is that? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot very, my friends. Not very. <br/>\r\nBut not impossible either.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo that leaves us with our  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  targets which we are close to hitting. And in fact, we have already hit our weekly  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  targets on ES: <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/H3YkxHQz\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/H3YkxHQz\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nIf there was ever a time for support to be found and a bounce to be had, it would be here. As  <a href=\"/ideas/commodities/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">futures</span></a>  is now technically on its range support.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWill it hold?  <br/>\r\nProbably not.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut  <a href=\"/ideas/commodities/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">futures</span></a>  is in the same dilemma with its monthly highs outside of its regression channel range: <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/GCCi685x\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/GCCi685x\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nAgain, this is a well established channel with a very high Pearson correlation.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat said, with  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  anything can happen. And to be honest, because we are straddling the mean, I am not so certain of selling here. I mean, the obvious answer is short it into  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  but maybe its too obvious.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe overall probabilities this week were  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  favouring. However, I have seen the probabilities fail many times on  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  and FOMC weeks, so I don't take this seriously.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI am actually personally not overly confident one way or another here. This isn't an obvious setup like jobs data was.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat said, I don't really expect  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:SPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-SPY/\"><span>SPY</span> </a></span>  to be able to realistically break out of this regression downtrend to the upside. IT just seems so very unlikely. It would be the ultimate F you to the world for this to just go parabolic to the upside and breakout. But it honestly wouldn't be the first time the market has given us all the middle finger. So being open minded is important.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe probabilities on the monthly actually favour further downside.  However, based on stochastics alone, there is a favouring of bullishness, but in the totality of the technicals (stochastics,  <a href=\"/ideas/relativestrengthindex/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">RSI</span></a> , Z Score etc)there is a general favouring of bearishness.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nVerdict:  <br/>\r\nI am overall  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a> , expecting further downside. I am expecting us to hit our monthly lows at some point this month because overall the probabilities favour a  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  continuation on the monthly timeframes.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat said, I am mixed on the weekly really.  <br/>\r\nLooking at other tickers like  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:AMZN\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-AMZN/\"><span>AMZN</span> </a></span>  and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:MSFT\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-MSFT/\"><span>MSFT</span> </a></span> , we have yet to hit the monthly lows, with tickers like  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:AMZN\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-AMZN/\"><span>AMZN</span> </a></span> ,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>TSLA</span> </a></span>  and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:MSFT\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-MSFT/\"><span>MSFT</span> </a></span>  having a high probabiltiy favouring of the monthly lows. <br/>\r\nThis leads me to believe that, in the totality of the market,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  should result in downside to bring these tickers to their monthly lows and to bring  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:SPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-SPY/\"><span>SPY</span> </a></span>  deep into its weekly lows. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThat said, I am actually going to position myself conservatively going into  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span> . While there really is no reason to play pre-CPI, you can honestly bank once you have the direction confirmed at 8:30, I am probably going to do a really inexpensive straddle on  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:IWM\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-IWM/\"><span>IWM</span> </a></span> . Weekly expiries (Friday) in either direction, knowing very well that we are going to see a dramatic move one way or the other. That way I can rest assured that I don't really need to care what the market decides.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMy thoughts, <br/>\r\nTrade safe! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLeave your comments, questions and critiques below!! <br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/1/16armyK8_big.png", "comments": "[{\"id\":9294033,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9294033,\"comment\":\"Have you looked at other timeframes?\",\"comment_ast\":{\"type\":\"root\",\"children\":[\"Have you looked at other timeframes?\"]},\"created_at\":\"2022-10-12T17:03:24.050169Z\",\"editable_until\":\"2022-10-12T17:18:24.050169Z\",\"likes_count\":0,\"user_vote\":0,\"user\":{\"id\":28215102,\"avatars\":{\"small\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/28215102-K5XT.png\",\"mid\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/28215102-K5XT_mid.png\",\"big\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/28215102-K5XT_big.png\",\"orig\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/28215102-K5XT_orig.png\"},\"username\":\"JoeChampion\",\"is_broker\":false,\"is_pro\":true,\"is_paid_pro\":true,\"pro_plan\":\"pro_premium\",\"broker_plan\":null,\"is_moderator\":false,\"is_trial\":false,\"badges\":[{\"name\":\"pro:pro_premium\",\"verbose_name\":\"Premium\"}],\"is_online\":false},\"spam_status\":null,\"is_hidden\":false,\"depth\":0,\"platform\":null,\"platform_link_url\":null,\"platform_link_text\":null,\"coins\":null},{\"id\":9293422,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9293422,\"comment\":\"I went long premarket, had to play the chop to get my positions down, but was able to get a few buys on the lows and am slightly green on the day... it's a nail bitter!\",\"comment_ast\":{\"type\":\"root\",\"children\":[\"I went long premarket, had to play the chop to get my positions down, but was able to get a few buys on the lows and am slightly green on the day... it's a nail bitter!\"]},\"created_at\":\"2022-10-12T15:18:35.578734Z\",\"editable_until\":\"2022-10-12T15:33:35.578734Z\",\"likes_count\":0,\"user_vote\":0,\"user\":{\"id\":41347327,\"avatars\":{\"small\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%2239%22%20height=%2239%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%2815,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3EM%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"mid\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%2296%22%20height=%2296%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%2815,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3EM%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"big\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%22320%22%20height=%22320%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%2815,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3EM%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"orig\":null},\"username\":\"Mr_Clark_SD\",\"is_broker\":false,\"is_pro\":true,\"is_paid_pro\":true,\"pro_plan\":\"pro\",\"broker_plan\":null,\"is_moderator\":false,\"is_trial\":false,\"badges\":[{\"name\":\"pro:pro\",\"verbose_name\":\"Pro\"}],\"is_online\":false},\"spam_status\":null,\"is_hidden\":false,\"depth\":0,\"platform\":null,\"platform_link_url\":null,\"platform_link_text\":null,\"coins\":null},{\"id\":9291065,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9291065,\"comment\":\"\\\" It would be the ultimate F you to the world for this to just go parabolic to the upside and breakout.\\\" Steve I believe those that can move this market are in fact going to raise the middle finger, The smack down pain is not intense enough yet.
