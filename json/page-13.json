Here's a quick chart look of our EMA's.  <br/>\n</a></strong>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/bSIqdvVT\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/bSIqdvVT\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/phrDIUv8/\" target=\"_blank\"> <br/>\r\n⚡️I try to keep these ideas concise and explain/make sense of price action and the markets the best I can but I know it may not always be the easiest sometimes so bear with me on that, I'm learning and getting better at that with each idea but basically I give what I can to these charts and I simply learn with each new mark and move that happens. This is a long journey we're on but it's one well worth it. If you'd like to leave a like or follow it'd be much appreciated of course and have a great day.
