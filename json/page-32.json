With the benefit of hindsight, this exposure couldn‚Äôt have been more incorrect, and central bankers pushed back hard.

While we saw a slight softening in the headline level of job creation (to 263k), the bulls were clearly positioned for an unemployment rate of 3.8% (not 3.5%), and a higher participation rate, and when we marry this with a sizeable 4.8% rally in crude, and rising concerns of $100 a barrel again, a buyers strike ensued in risky assets (e.g equities), and it was all sellers of risk, with the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FOREXCOM:NSXUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/FOREXCOM-NSXUSD/\"><span>NAS100</span> </a></span>  the posterchild of movement -3.9% on Friday and eyeing a new trend low.  <br/>\r\nIn the week ahead, US  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  is the marquee event risk and when we see expectations that core  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  will rise 20bp to 6.5% (from 6.3%), it will give the Fed even more fodder to keep tightening financial conditions. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe short sellers are having it all their way ‚Äì we have no  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  support and if anything they are welcoming a recession, that is not yet fully discounted into valuations or risk ‚Äì geopolitical concerns are rising ‚Äì bond yields are reversing and eyeing a re-test of recent highs. The bears will all point out that fed fund ‚Äòterminal‚Äô rate pricing has risen to 4.65% and could be ready to take another leg higher towards 5% if this week's US  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  comes in hotter.

This ultra-bearish sentiment plays into the risk v reward trade-off, and it suggests if we hear something remotely positive, and we see better flow, the result will be a pronounced equity counter-rally, and this may incentives funds to reduce USD longs as the default equity hedge.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nConversely, it could also be another brutal week, and one suspects if it is it will get truly ugly and see market chatter around coordinated policy response increase ‚Äì liquidity remains a core consideration that exacerbates moves as funds try and get out of positions ‚Äì spreads in the underlying market have widened in response and the cost to trade for institutional funds has increased. In this backdrop it pays to take the timeframe down, understand that markets can turn on a dime and on little news and quite often these moves make little sense ‚Äì nail your position size, have an open mind, and react with intent ‚Äì this will serve you well and keep you in the game.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile we watch the USD, US real rates, the Fed‚Äôs  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">balance sheet</span></a>  dynamics and measures of  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a> , we assess the key known event risks traders need to navigate portfolio through this week. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe week ahead: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAussie home loan values (Tuesday 11:30 AEDT) ‚Äì the data is unlikely to be too impactful on the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"PEPPERSTONE:AUS200\"><a href=\"/symbols/PEPPERSTONE-AUS200/\"><span>AUS200</span> </a></span>  or AUD, but the cooling in lending is a big macro consideration ‚Äì this is not just indicative of a slowdown in the demand for loans for residential property, but also business loans ‚Äì The market expects home loan values to fall 3% in August, with owner-occupier loans seeing the bigger falls -3.5%.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nRBA meeting (Tuesday 14:30 AEDT) ‚Äì the market prices a hike of 44bp, with 16/21 economists calling for the 50bp hike, so a 50bp is largely priced ‚Äì We look at pricing for the November RBA meeting and see this is finely balanced at 35bp, where I lean towards a 25bp hike - we see that expectations are that the RBA cash rate pushes to 4.10% by June ‚Äò23 ‚Äì this is the ‚Äòterminal‚Äô pricing.  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:AUDUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/AUDUSD/\"><span>AUDUSD</span> </a></span>  1-week implied  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a>  is close to 52-week highs, so the market looks for movement and this suggests reduced position size.

Moves from the BoE to temporarily buy 20yr+ gilts and portray a monster rate hike in Nov have reduced cable vol, but we also know the bond-buying program is supposedly a stop-gap measure ‚Äì there is no easy trade here ‚Äì fundamentally, the bear case in GBP looks strongest, but technically there‚Äôs a two-way risk. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOPEC meeting (Wed) ‚Äì the first in-person meeting since March 2020, it could be lively and one for crude trade to put on the radar - talk of output cuts to the tune of 0.5-1.0 million BPD is making waves, with Russia pushing for a 1m barrel cut ‚Äì as always we react to news flow here ‚Äì I like a re-test of the Sept lows of $76.22, but the bigger the output cut, the less likely the lows will be hit.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUS ISM manufacturing (Tue 01:00 AEDT) ‚Äì the market looks for the diffusion index to print 52.1 (from 52.8), where we look into the sub-components for real context, notably the ‚Äòprices paid‚Äô and ‚Äòsupplier delivery‚Äô sub-surveys ‚Äì however, unless we see the headline index below 50.0 it shouldn‚Äôt cause any major ripples, but with sentiment so shot the unexpected can easily rip.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUS JOLTS report (Wed 01:00 AEDT) ‚Äì with the US labour market such a hot topic, we go into the labour report expecting 11.075M jobs openings. This would be a modest decline from the 11.239m job openings we saw in July ‚Äì risky assets would find relief buying/short covering on a below consensus number, although we‚Äôd need a dramatic downside miss to really get the party started. A hotter number would be a USD positive and see fresh lows in the US500/ <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FOREXCOM:NSXUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/FOREXCOM-NSXUSD/\"><span>NAS100</span> </a></span> .  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nISM services ‚Äì not typically a market mover, but we are watching to see if the service sector shows any clearer signs of fragility ‚Äì the consensus expects a read of 56.0 in September (from 56.9), which if comes to fruition is still solid expansion and supportive of risky assets.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUS Non-farm payrolls ( <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:FRI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-FRI/\"><span>Fri</span> </a></span>  23:30 AEDT) ‚Äì the marquee (known) event risk of the week ‚Äì the consensus expects 250k jobs to be created, with the economists forecast range seen between +389k to 200k ‚Äì perversely, a number below 200k would likely be taken as a positive for risky assets and would pull the USD lower. We also consider the unemployment rate with the consensus expecting this to remain at 3.7% - with  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  still top of mind, average hourly wages are expected at 5.1% (from 5.2%), so ahead of the Sept  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  print (13 Oct ‚Äì expecting headline  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  to print 8.1%), the wage data could be influential. Risky assets (like equities) would find buyers on a sub-5% print. <br/>\n<br/>\r\n14 Fed speakers ‚Äì hard to see too much change from the recent Fed chatter but there has been some cooling of  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  expectations, amid the tighter financial conditions, so any acknowledgement of these moves could be positive for risk.

It raises the prospect that other economists revise their  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  calls soon as well - the BoE is forecasting  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  to reach 13%, but their forecasts may again need to be reviewed, as they tend to be slower moving than private sector economists. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe know UK headline  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  has been largely driven by supply side issues, notably by an incredible rise in gas, electricity, and food prices. Rate hikes are very much on the cards, and the BoE will almost certainly lift the bank rates by 50bp to 2.25% on 15 Sept, but this will do almost nothing to  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"EURONEXT:ALTER\"><a href=\"/symbols/EURONEXT-ALTER/\"><span>alter</span> </a></span>  the trajectory of  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  ‚Äì it‚Äôs all heading to a sizeable squeeze in domestic demand which should negatively impact the UK corporate landscape, and invariably lead to deeper negative real wages, layoffs, and higher unemployment rates. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne could also see a world where the UK economy heads to a recession, slack builds in the economy and various measures of medium-and longer-term  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  expectations fall ‚Äì subsequently, the BoE cut rates in late 2023/24 ‚Äì a vision the market currently shares with 60bp of cuts priced into UK (tradeable) interest rate curve for 2024. However, if UK  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  does indeed move into the high teens, and the BoE sees entrenched ‚Äòsticky‚Äô  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> , then one could feasibly see a world where the BoE hike the bank rate to 5% to 6%, and not the 4% that the market currently discounts as the ‚Äòterminal‚Äô rate. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAgain, it plays into the idea that the playbook of outcomes is so incredibly diverse, and this is a massive headache for the BoE, as well as those trying to position investment portfolios. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOfgem price caps in full focus  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking at the unfolding  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  dynamics ‚Äì one piece of news that is being watched closely this week will be the Ofgem price caps for October ‚Äì this  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:INTC\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-INTC/\"><span>intel</span> </a></span>  essentially details the cap that suppliers can charge households (effective 1 October) and is the poster child of modern-day  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> . Estimates for the Ofgem cap currently sit around ¬£3600, up from ¬£1971 in April. However, this figure is then expected to increase by 26% in January 2023 and 27% in April 2023 ‚Äì this will genuinely hurt households and businesses. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOn a political note, Liz Truss is looking to implement fiscal measures to the tune of ¬£30b (c.1.4% of GDP) to address the cost-of-living crisis, with the suspension of the Green Levy and cuts on VAT on household energy bills. However, these measures will be no panacea. They may support growth but will be deficit funded and require the UK Treasury to consider gilt issuance, which may raise bond yields and broad borrowing costs, especially given the backdrop of BoE QT ‚Äì in this case, a GBP negative. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking more broadly at GBP fundamentals ‚Äì Personal consumption is in decline; business investment is weak, and UK GDP is deteriorating with Q2 GDP -0.1% QoQ - it seems likely this will only get worse as higher  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  breaks the social fabric, cementing a negative feedback loop to consumers spending behaviours. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe UK's current account is falling away as trade is being affected by Brexit and lacklustre external demand ‚Äì with the UK's biggest trading partner - Europe - also facing a tough winter and a protracted economic slowdown. The UK‚Äôs capital account is also deteriorating, so the GBP is facing rising balance of payments concerns <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span>  to 1.1500? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn essence, the UK is facing a number of economic considerations which suggest significant GBP headwinds ‚Äì from where I sit, we can like the GBP from a rising rates perspective, but when UK real rates are likely headed lower, relative expected growth and investment attraction favour the US, While forecasts offer traders no edge,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span>  seems destined for 1.1500 over time, perhaps lower.

Expected  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a>  has subsided thanks to the temporary resumption of the BoE‚Äôs long-duration bond buying measures, as well as the humbling  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:U-NASDAQ:TURN\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-U/\"><span>U-turn</span> </a></span>  on plans to scrap the 45% tax rate ‚Äì while a strong global equity rally is also offering tailwinds for  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span> .  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:U-NASDAQ:TURN\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-U/\"><span>U-turn</span> </a></span>  ‚Äì but is there more? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Tory party conference is currently in play and lasts through to Wednesday, and so far, the atmosphere has been incredibly downbeat ‚Äì all the focus has been on chancellor Kwarteng being forced to walk back his highly unpopular top income tax plan. The market understands this action almost had to happen to avoid a complete implosion of the Tory party, and at the margin does take some pressure off Truss and the BoE ‚Äì where we see the UK rates market pricing out 30bp of hikes to price the BoE ‚Äòs bank rate at 5.59% for the May 2023 meeting. This is the point where the market sees the highest pricing (or ‚Äòterminal‚Äô) of BoE‚Äôs bank rate in the future.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe question for traders is whether this move is a signal for a full reversal of all the measures announced in the ‚Äòmini budget‚Äô last week. On its own, the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:U-NASDAQ:TURN\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-U/\"><span>U-turn</span> </a></span>  on the top bracket tax plan is not a game changer for the GBP as it represents just 4.5% of the expected ¬£45b cost of which the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:GOVT\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-GOVT/\"><span>govt</span> </a></span>  would need to reach out to the capital markets to  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FRED:BORROW\"><a href=\"/symbols/FRED-BORROW/\"><span>borrow</span> </a></span> .  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, if the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:U-NASDAQ:TURN\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-U/\"><span>U-turn</span> </a></span>  is really a precursor to a full unwind of the fiscal stimulus, then that is a genuine GBP positive, as it would reduce expectations of an increased governments funding requirement over the coming 2 years and therefore higher borrowing costs ‚Äì interestingly, we‚Äôve seen headlines that at least two cabinet ministers say the ‚ÄúTruss project is over‚Äù because she failed to bring them along on the key policy objectives.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span>  has already easily reclaimed the level of 1.1274 it was trading before the mini budget, it feels like if we were to hear an announcement of a full reversal of the budget measures then  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span>  could squeeze past 1.1400. If and when this announcement comes is a major consideration, but we may need to see renewed selling of UK bonds (gilts) and further GBP downside to put enough pressure on the Truss  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:GOVT\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-GOVT/\"><span>govt</span> </a></span>  to take this fairly radical action.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat if the current fiscal measures do pass through the Commons? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe should consider the scenario where the remaining fiscal measures are passed when voted on when parliament resumes on 11 October ‚Äì this is the scenario where we may be getting to levels that interest GBP shorts, certainly against the crosses. The fact that so many GBP shorts have been flushed out has led to a far cleaner position.

The USD pairs, notably  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDJPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDJPY/\"><span>USDJPY</span> </a></span> ,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDCNH\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDCNH/\"><span>USDCNH</span> </a></span>  and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDCHF\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDCHF/\"><span>USDCHF</span> </a></span>  are ripping ‚Äì We see the JPY as the weakest though with  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDJPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDJPY/\"><span>USDJPY</span> </a></span>  spiking to 143.59 in early trade today, on what looks like a stop run through yesterday's session highs and amid thin liquidity. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe trade-weighted JPY sits at the lowest level since 2007 and some are questioning if the risks of verbal JPY jawboning from the Bank of Japan or the Ministry of Finance (MoF) have increased? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nPotentially, but in this current bond driven dynamic the market will pounce on JPY weakness. Consider that we haven‚Äôt seen a sizeable lift in Japan‚Äôs  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  expectations as a consequence of Japan importing  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  (through the FX channels) and that will appease the BoJ. Commodity prices have come well off the highs, which will benefit energy importers (like Japan).  <br/>\r\nHowever, we are back to trading  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  divergence ‚Äì FX trading in its purest form, albeit from a fundamental perspective. Don‚Äôt fight the Fed means staying long the USD, at least for now. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe can see the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  divergence manifest in the FX forwards markets, where corporate treasurers are able to roll over  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDJPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDJPY/\"><span>USDJPY</span> </a></span>  exposures for 12 months at a 600-pip  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"TASE:DSCT\"><a href=\"/symbols/TASE-DSCT/\"><span>discount</span> </a></span>  ‚Äì interest rate parity dictates this, but when you get this level of carry you know the JPY has very little safe-haven qualities, and in this current environment the JPY is simply a bond proxy. For the JPY to really head higher bond yields need to trend lower ‚Äì the JPY (and perhaps  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>gold</span> </a></span> ) would become the default hedge if bond yields really started to head lower on global recession fears ‚Äì not a trade for right now, but it could play out in late 2022 ‚Äì recognise the signs and have the theme on the radar. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fact we continue to watch US bond yields climb is pushing more capital into the USD ‚Äì some of the recent moves can be explained by US corporates issuing a high level of corporate debt and the market having to sell out of other fixed income instruments to fund this. Some have been driven by slightly better US data (ISM services for example). <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUS ‚Äòreal‚Äô rates (US Treasuries adjusted for expected  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> ) are moving higher and higher. It also feels like the USD market is front-running Fed Quantitative Tightening (QT), which ramps up to the incredible pace of $95b this month - we have seen a strong relationship between falling Fed reserve liabilities and the USD and if this relationship is maintained then  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDJPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDJPY/\"><span>USDJPY</span> </a></span>  could be headed for Y150+ over time. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDraining reserves (system liquidity) aside, the real effect from QT would come if the US Treasury were to beef up issuing longer-duration Treasuries in late 2022/early 2023 ‚Äì when you remove a price-insensitive buyer (the Fed) from the market the private sector is asked to step up the heavy lifting, and that can mean compensation in the form of higher bond yields. <br/>\r\nIs the FX market front-running this QT process‚Ä¶? Feels like that is the case. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe BoJ on the other hand remain steadfast in its dovish stance and the market may start to think about taking them on again. We shall see, but the easier trade has just been to short the JPY, than the Japanese bond market. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNext Tuesday we get US August  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span> , and this could be huge for the markets and especially the USD. The market will go into a frenzy of excitement about the implications of the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  print, but in a world where we‚Äôre so desperate to hear of peak  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  if we get an upside surprise, it could be painful for USD shorts. Of course, with the world so long of USDs, a downside surprise vs consensus, especially if it came from both headline and core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> .

With the Fed moving to a more data-dependent/balanced structure last week felt as though we saw a temporary ‚Äògoldilocks‚Äô scenario ‚Äì if the data proved to be poor then rates hikes are priced out, bond yields fall and the USD found sellers ‚Äì subsequently, we buy growth equity, crypto,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>gold</span> </a></span>  and the JPY. If the data proves to be better, then we speculate the recession trade may have gone too far. One thing is clear, bad news has been bad news for the USD and certainly versus the JPY, with  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDJPY\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDJPY/\"><span>USDJPY</span> </a></span>  -2.1% on the week ‚Äì falling through the 50-day MA, which has worked as a primary trend filter since March. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFrom a momentum perspective, my indicators are  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  and there are few reasons to be short ‚Äì the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FOREXCOM:NSXUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/FOREXCOM-NSXUSD/\"><span>NAS100</span> </a></span>  has some big levels to break into  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FWB:13K\"><a href=\"/symbols/FWB-13K/\"><span>13k</span> </a></span>  ‚Äì an upside break here could suggest adding to longs. The USDX tests the lower levels of the regression channel (drawn from the Jan lows), while  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:EURUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/EURUSD/\"><span>EURUSD</span> </a></span>  consolidates in a 1.0100 to 1.0270 range.  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"OANDA:XAUUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/XAUUSD/\"><span>XAUUSD</span> </a></span>  looks interesting for $1786 but requires a weaker USD and lower real rates and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"PEPPERSTONE:SPOTCRUDE\"><a href=\"/symbols/PEPPERSTONE-SPOTCRUDE/\"><span>SpotCrude</span> </a></span>  needs to break out of a $95 to $103.70 range. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe battle lines are drawn, but tactically I would be looking more favourably at short-risk trades ‚Äì as always, when the tactical/fundamental view and technicals disagree on the longer-timeframes I'll back Mr Market, especially if using leverage. However, I see a refresh this week in the markets thinking and good economic should see the market price a greater chance of another 75bp hike from the Fed in the September meeting and now US Q2  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">earnings</span></a>  are drawing to a close, and financial conditions are more accommodative than they were before the Fed hiked the fed funds rate by 75bp last week - one suspects the Fed will not want to take the foot the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  break just yet. Feels like the skew of risk is for the Fed to gently tighten financial conditions and discourage greater risk-taking from hedge funds. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe can also see the bank reserves held at the Fed increased by $40.4b last week ‚Äì this looks at the liability side of the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">balance sheet</span></a>  and has correlated well with growth and high beta equity and gives a good guide to liquidity. If this was to turn lower, and we won‚Äôt know until Thursday, then it will hold well with a weaker equity tape. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking at the calendar we have the RBA and BoE meeting ‚Äì we can see  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span>  1-week implied vols are still quite elevated and could easily see some moves play out in the quid. I think they go 25bp myself, which offers moderate GBP risk, but the job of the trader is to run the distribution of potential outcomes and assess the sort of moves that could play out. In the US, the ISM manufacturing report, payrolls, and Fed speakers will garner my close attention. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter a huge July, we turn to the Northern Hemisphere summer holiday trading conditions ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt feel like traders should be shutting up shop and taking a break given the unfolding dynamics, even if it can be the best thing for the mind. <br/>\n</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/m/MqVSetOB_big.png", "comments": "[]"}, {"title": "S&P500 Trade Idea", "name": "Pepperstone", "time": "", "link": "/chart/US500/OIQytZot-S-P500-Trade-Idea/", "contents": ["<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">Bulls pushed price through the downtrend line and the 50-day  <a href=\"/ideas/simplemovingaverage/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">SMA</span></a> , but these gains look precarious.

The market places a 97% chance of a 75bp hike. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nManaging the risk  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt‚Äôs the meeting everyone has on their radar ‚Äì implied  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a>  in equity and FX is elevated and rising, and the market will be hanging off every word Fed chair Jerome Powell has to say - it is a genuine risk event for traders to consider. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraders must consider their exposures over this meeting and while position sizing is always of paramount importance, now, more than ever, traders need to be in front of their screens. When we see a potential  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a>  shock, this is risk management 101, traders who get this right survive and potentially thrive. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Fed previous guided the market to a 50bp hike but since its blackout period (which restricted its communication) we‚Äôve had a huge 8.6%  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  print and both bonds and equities have been smashed ‚Äì the USD is trading at 20-year highs, with big moves vs high beta FX ‚Äì  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:NOK\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-NOK/\"><span>NOK</span> </a></span> , AUD and NZD and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:GBPUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/GBPUSD/\"><span>GBPUSD</span> </a></span>  shorts are homing in on 1.2000. The market knows the Fed is violently engineering a negative wealth effect, which will impact demand and that means the ‚ÄòFed put‚Äô is no longer in play.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraders question whether the Fed show any concerns about market drawdown and the tighter financial conditions, or in fact, welcomes it ‚Äì risk assets could take their cues from this vibe. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs the WSJ noted, the new US  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  print allows the Fed to break away from its prior guidance (for 50bp) and the interest rate markets have completely bought into the idea that we‚Äôll see a 75bp hike ‚Äì this is fully priced into markets. We can also see a 67bp hike priced for the July meeting. This takes the fed funds rate into the so-called ‚Äòneutral rate‚Äô (the level of the fed funds that is estimated to be neither accommodative nor restrictive) ‚Äì this is the level the fed funds really need to be and quickly. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nA 50bp hike should therefore promote a weaker USD, but how equities trade on this outcome is not immediately clear ‚Äì in theory, it should cause a rally in stocks, but this is genuinely unclear. The market could easily see a risk that the Fed is falling further behind the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  curve and going into further risk aversion mode. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEconomic and fed funds projections <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTraders will be watching for the Fed‚Äôs economic projections ‚Äì expect a solid decline in GDP expectations for 2022 (from 2.8% towards 2%). Watch the Fed‚Äôs unemployment forecasts for 2023, as this could offer real guidance on a potential recession, and it would not surprise if the Fed took its estimate for 2023 from 3.5% to 3.8% - the market could react to this. On  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> , it will not surprise to see a material lift in core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  in 2022 from 4.1% to over 4.5%. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Feds dot plot will get the focus too ‚Äì the current projection for the fed funds rate sits at 1.9% for 2022, 2.8% for 2023, 2.8% for 2024 and the longer-run estimate is 2.4% - if the Fed hike by 75bp then 2022 estimate should lift above 3%. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSummary ‚Äì the question I ask is if I were to obtain the Fed statement and Jay Powell‚Äôs script prior to anyone else would I be guaranteed to make money from it ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure I would.

Obviously, sentiment is shot to pieces and it's a tough environment for any listed entity, with few wanting to take on risk especially in high beta growth equities, regardless of the news flow from the company. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFundamentally, we can focus on the big underperformance of  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Tesla</span> </a></span>  since  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Elon Musk</span> </a></span>  disclosed his intention to purchase  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:TWTR\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-TWTR/\"><span>Twitter</span> </a></span>  - There are multiple schools of thought on why this is the case, although Musk has tried to assure the market that his focus on  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Tesla</span> </a></span>  will not wane. China is slowing down because of its Covid zero policy and we‚Äôre now seeing  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">earnings</span></a>  downgrades from analysts due to the loss of production in Shanghai, with a view that the slowdown is going to genuinely impact margins and  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">earnings</span></a> . <br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Earnings</span></a>  downgrades are usually laggards to price in this type of market anyhow, and the market discounts known news far more rapidly than any analyst can downgrade  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">earnings</span></a> . <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat‚Äôs important here is the trend and it's clearly lower ‚Äì this makes me incredibly cautious in trying to catch what is essentially a falling knife. Naturally, broader market sentiment is key, so if the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:SPX500\"><a href=\"/symbols/FX-SPX500/\"><span>S&amp;P500</span> </a></span>  and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FOREXCOM:NSXUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/FOREXCOM-NSXUSD/\"><span>NAS100</span> </a></span>  can in fact turn higher, and we see rate hikes being priced out of the swaps curve, with a further liquidation of USD longs, then  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Tesla</span> </a></span>  should turn higher. A big ‚Äòif‚Äô of course. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe can see that  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Tesla</span> </a></span>  is oversold but it's been that way for a while, and yet it keeps falling. Timing is always key, and it depends on one‚Äôs strategy ‚Äì if trading momentum or a trend follower - notably for swing/position traders - then you‚Äôre likely short already and not seen an exit signal yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor scalpers and day traders there are a different set of conditions and considerations. One aspect is that price is 31% below its 50-day MA - aside from March 2020 we‚Äôve never seen such a differential since  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Tesla</span> </a></span>  floated ‚Äì is this a sign the elastic band has been pulled too far and we could see mean reversion? Perhaps, but when markets are in freefall and we‚Äôre seeing both fundamental and technical factors impacting then what‚Äôs oversold can continue to be so. <br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NASDAQ:TSLA\"><a href=\"/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/\"><span>Tesla</span> </a></span>  is one to put on the radar‚Ä¶I think this can trade into $600 through June, but when I think of the distribution of outcomes the prospect of a short-term rally into $650/80 also looks promising, but I think this gives shorts better levels to look at.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:CW\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-CW/\"><span>CW</span> </a></span> <br/>\n</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/4/4SAhwZjn_big.png", "comments": "[]"}]
