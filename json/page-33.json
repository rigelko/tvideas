However, the  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  move in the USD sits firmly on momentum trader’s radar, while Pepperstone clients are skewed short suggesting they are seeing mean reversion as the base case. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe USDX is up for six consecutive days, and while it is statistically rare to see seven straight days of gains, we question if the USD basket can break above 100 soon? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking back over the past 5 sessions and we see  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:EURUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/EURUSD/\"><span>EURUSD</span> </a></span>  -1.6% - the worst performing pair in G10 FX – predominantly driven by relative bond yield differentials in favour of USDs, we also watch for Sunday’s first-round French presidential election – with the polls becoming closer for the second round (24 April) and in favour of  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NSE:MARINE\"><a href=\"/symbols/NSE-MARINE/\"><span>Marine</span> </a></span>  Le Pen, there seems there are some who are hedging risks here with short EUR and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"GLOBALPRIME:FRA40\"><a href=\"/symbols/GLOBALPRIME-FRA40/\"><span>FRA40</span> </a></span>  index positions. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe USDX has naturally benefited from the recent EUR weakness, where technically the break of the  <a href=\"/ideas/doublebottom/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">double bottom</span></a>  neckline targets 101.30, with 100.54 also near-term resistance. 100 is a psychological barrier and we’ll need to see  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:EURUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/EURUSD/\"><span>EURUSD</span> </a></span>  into 1.0800 for that to play out and the way  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:EURUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/EURUSD/\"><span>EURUSD</span> </a></span>  is trending it seems the likely course of action. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking at the fundamental backdrop - the world is long of USDs, which is having some handbrake on its ability to really get going, but there are still many attractions of owning it. Firstly, it’s going up and that’s a great start – buy strong, sell weak is a prudent way to skew the odds someway to your favour.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe US has the highest  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span> <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  rate in the G10 FX region, and next week we should see this even higher with the market looking for a 50bp increase in the year-on-year print to get to 8.4% - if this print does come to pass it just reinforces the need for the Fed to step it right up and hike by 50bp in May and start its process of reducing its  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">balance sheet</span></a>  and reserves. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe can look at forward rates and see that hedge and pension funds and corporate Treasury divisions can obtain relative higher carry from US rates, and only  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"TSXV:NZ\"><a href=\"/symbols/TSXV-NZ/\"><span>NZ</span> </a></span>  has a higher 2-year bond yield. We can see US real Treasury rates are now -19bp, and not far off turning positive, which is impressive considering they were -110bp in early March <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf US real rates turn positive, then it could act as a sizeable headwind for equity returns, which again if we see a renewed drawdown in the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:SPX500\"><a href=\"/symbols/FX-SPX500/\"><span>S&amp;P500</span> </a></span>  may feedback into USD appreciation, with the USD retaining its safe-haven status.US growth is in relatively good shape, although we are watching consumer confidence closely – certainly, the labour market is in fine form and the household savings rate is still high enough to absorb high  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> . <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nI do think  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDCNH\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDCNH/\"><span>USDCNH</span> </a></span>  is well worth watching – like other FX pairs, client interest in this cross is driven by trending conditions, the  <a href=\"/ideas/rateofchange/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">rate of change</span></a>  and general  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a> . A trend would have big implications for broad FX markets, and I do sit in the camp that if we see a higher  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:USDCNH\"><a href=\"/symbols/USDCNH/\"><span>USDCNH</span> </a></span> , notably if we see a break of 6.4100, then this will flow into further USD strength vs G10 FX. Whilst fundamentals don’t tend to influence the yuan as much as major currencies, there does seem to be growing downside risk for the yuan – a weaker current surplus,  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  running at a low 0.9%, the yield advantage in Chinese bonds diminishing vs US and growth called into question over its Covid-zero stance. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI like the cross higher, which as I say should feed into broad USD appreciation – that said, near-term we watch to see if US bond yields keep moving higher, with eyes on US  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span> , and equity  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a> . The French presidential election and the ECB meeting also pose risks <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo me, the balance of risk is skewed to a higher USD, but there may be some wood to chop to get through 100. <br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/f/FWt0dlpR_big.png", "comments": "[]"}, {"title": "Is crypto (ETH) the new AUDJPY?", "name": "Pepperstone", "time": "", "link": "/chart/ETHUSD/4ATLZOsn-Is-crypto-ETH-the-new-AUDJPY/", "contents": ["<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">There's a nice shape to the crypto moves of late, and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:ETHUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/ETHUSD/\"><span>Ethereum</span> </a></span>  is one we’re seeing better flow with 82% of open positions held long.

The obvious upside level now that we’ve taken out the 16 Nov swing of 1877 is 1916 – a break of 1916 and 1923 (the 61.8% fibo of the ATH to March 2021) and we can realistically talk about 2050/60. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe are seeing trend-follower capital moving into the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>gold</span> </a></span>  market but looking at CFTC report managed money positioning is still light, and there is far more capital still to be deployed if this trend continues.

The days of hedging  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  are behind us, as we seek to understand gold’s role in the portfolio.  <br/>\r\n6.\t <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  is going up – momentum and trend-following funds are adding length here – buy strong is the call. <br/>\r\n7.\tWe see options traders are  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  – 1-week risk reversals (1-week call implied  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a>  minus put vol) trades at 1.4 and 1month 1.32 – this is the highest  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  skew since January 2021. The market is saying if we are to see a move then the rallies are likely to be more pronounced than the downside over these periods. What’s important is the skew is not extreme yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe question on the future for  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>gold</span> </a></span>  is two-fold: <br/>\n<br/>\r\n1.\tHow will the Russia/Ukraine situation play out? A move to $2000 possibly requires a more sinister turn to play out. Conversely, if we see a move to a diplomatic agreement then geopolitical hedges will likely be unwound.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\n2.\tWould a 50bp hike from the Fed in the 16 March FOMC meeting be good or bad for gold? The next NFP print (5 March) and Feb  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:CPI\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-CPI/\"><span>CPI</span> </a></span>  print (11 March) could decide that course of action. Historically a 50bp hike (when swaps price a 34% chance of 50bp) would be negative for  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>gold</span> </a></span>  as both real and nominal bond yields spike, however, I question if the market sees a 50bp hike accelerating the need to hedge a policy mistake, with the curve further flattening to inversion. Whilst nothing is certain, could  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>gold</span> </a></span>  rally on a hawkish FOMC outcome? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs always in trading, it pays to keep an open mind.  <br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/f/FdESCwpm_big.png", "comments": "[]"}, {"title": "Russell 2000 Trade Idea", "name": "Pepperstone", "time": "", "link": "/chart/US2000/qE4yHfoX-Russell-2000-Trade-Idea/", "contents": ["<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">The  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"RUSSELL:RUT\"><a href=\"/symbols/RUSSELL-RUT/\"><span>Russell 2000 Index</span> </a></span>  is having a nice rally.

The crash in the bond market has been underway for years, but the tipping point occurred when the UK prime minister pledged to cut taxes at a time when  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  is soaring into the double digits. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCutting taxes worsens  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  because less taxes means consumers have more money to spend on inflating goods. Cutting taxes while  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  is high therefore risks worsening  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  or inducing hyperinflation. Fear of this caused the price of UK bonds to crash and yields to spike. (As many of you know well, bond prices move down when yields rise). This crash caused pension funds with highly leveraged bond positions to experience amplified losses, which caused these funds to need to put up more cash collateral on their losing positions. This could have caused a downward spiral because these funds may have had to sell bonds to raise more cash, which would have had a negative feedback loop that could have sent prices down further, amplifying losses more, and creating the need to raise even more cash collateral. The Bank of England had to make an emergency purchase of bonds.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, by purchasing bonds, the Bank of England has taken an action that will now make  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  worse (there will be a lag effect). Whenever a  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  purchases bonds, it is adding liquidity to the system (when the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  buys bonds this has the effect of increasing the money supply).  Increasing the money supply when  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  is at a multi-decade high is super risky.  At best it could risk  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  staying elevated for longer, at worst it could spiral into hyperinflation.   <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the chart above, reproduced below, you can see that when priced in the British pound,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"CURRENCYCOM:OIL_CRUDE\"><a href=\"/symbols/CURRENCYCOM-OIL_CRUDE/\"><span>crude oil</span> </a></span>  prices are barely declining (as we would have expected from all the rate hikes). If anything,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"CURRENCYCOM:OIL_CRUDE\"><a href=\"/symbols/CURRENCYCOM-OIL_CRUDE/\"><span>crude oil</span> </a></span>  is looking poised to increase further.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/zC6gKUAT\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/zC6gKUAT\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nThe Bank of England, and other central banks, are trapped. Until they stop monetary easing (adding to the money supply) and tighten the money supply such that rates are higher than core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> ,  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  will continue to get worse.  Yet, as we now see in the UK, central banks cannot tighten the money supply sufficiently to accomplish this without causing a financial crisis.  The rapidity with which the Bank of England switched back on the money printer, despite double-digit  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> , has me convinced that central banks will choose the hyperinflation route.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn fact, hyperinflation is already happening in some countries.  Argentina has hiked rates to 75% (not 75  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"LSE:BPS\"><a href=\"/symbols/LSE-BPS/\"><span>bps</span> </a></span> , 75% or 7,500  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"LSE:BPS\"><a href=\"/symbols/LSE-BPS/\"><span>bps</span> </a></span> ) and yet  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  continues to spiral higher.  There is actually no limit to how bad  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  can get.  When people need to pay $100 trillion dollars for food, as in Zimbabwe in 2008, people usually stop believing that  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  fiat notes are valuable and the system collapses. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLook at the chart below. I did not log-adjust the chart so that you can see that hyperinflation is when commodity prices rise exponentially over time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/eX1UonDq\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/eX1UonDq\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nFor the chart, I used the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:IVZ\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-IVZ/\"><span>Invesco</span> </a></span>  Commodity Index Tracking Fund ( <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"AMEX:DBC\"><a href=\"/symbols/AMEX-DBC/\"><span>DBC</span> </a></span> ) and priced it in Argentine pesos. I used cross plots on a smoothened moving average. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis level of hyperinflation <strong>always</strong> leads to some kind of crisis. Either interest rates must crush demand and cause economic decline, or hyperinflation eventually causes a monetary crisis whereby people stop using the currency altogether.  Commodity hyperinflation also leads to political instability and the rise of fascist or communist dictators.  Furthermore, when these crises occur on a global scale, they can precipitate conflict, and conflict in turn can worsen commodity shortages. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFor those who have been thinking that  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  has peaked globally, there is no chart that I have seen which validates that conclusion.  Indeed, as shown in the chart below, commodity prices continue to break record highs in some parts of the world.  In most currencies, commodity prices appear to be bull flagging. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zz7iyJDP\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/Zz7iyJDP\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nCompare the below two charts. One shows how commodity prices continue to spiral higher in Argentina, despite the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  hiking rates all the way to 75%, compared to 2008, when commodity prices fell while the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  raised interest rates to just 12%.  This shows that we are dealing with a much more dangerous type of  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> .   <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/YC7uiZe5\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/YC7uiZe5\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nI posted these figures to show just how bad  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  can get and the risks associated with monetary easing. Many people are believing the pig-in-a-python theory, where they think  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  is transitory and will improve when the massive COVID stimulus passes through the pipeline. However, what they fail to realize is that central banks have been putting an endless stream of pigs in the python for decades through monetary easing. Economies have become totally dependent on monetary easing and central banks are now trapped in needing to maintain it. Yet, if central banks continue monetary easing,  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  cannot come down. It just keeps spiraling higher so long as monetary easing continues, assuming commodity shortages also continue. Commodity shortages are deep-rooted and are due in part to war, deglobalization, aging and less productive populations, and climate change to name several factors.   <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Monetary policy</span></a>  has little efficacy on these supply issues. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSri Lanka was the canary in the coal mine. It was the first central government to fall due to commodity hyperinflation. And yet, even after a central government collapse, commodity prices in Sri Lanka are still high. The chart below shows that  <a href=\"/ideas/commodities/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">commodities</span></a>  appear to be bull-flagging, and poised to go higher. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/aLMCDZNV\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/aLMCDZNV\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ACL0oTbG\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ACL0oTbG\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nCore  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  which is typically stable in the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"TSX:UNC\"><a href=\"/symbols/TSX-UNC/\"><span>United</span> </a></span>  States is now exploding to a 40-year high.  If the  <a href=\"/ideas/fred/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Federal Reserve</span></a>  is to be successful at hiking rates to quell  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> , it must hike rates above the core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  level. There is virtually no  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">central bank</span></a>  with an interest rate higher than core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> .  Indeed, Japan continues to maintain negative interest rates.  As I noted in a prior post, because negative interest rates incentivize the creation of money through credit, negative interest rates reflect limitless growth of the money supply.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/mrYjoD1E\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/mrYjoD1E\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, as alluded to above, the Fed is trapped. It must hike rates above core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> , but it also cannot hike rates above core  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> .  Decades of monetary easing have left a highly leveraged economy totally reliant on low interest rates. Hiking rates as far as would be needed to quell  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  would likely lead to an economic depression.  Pension funds are already under tremendous strain from the hiking and yet the charts show that the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"MYX:SCOPE\"><a href=\"/symbols/MYX-SCOPE/\"><span>scope</span> </a></span>  of tightening that will be necessary is not even in sight yet. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe best-case scenario is that commodity supplies improve and demand softens enough to stabilize rates but not so much that economies decline significantly.

It can buy bonds to suppress the interest rate but other than that it follows the natural market cycles. In times of bullish markets everyone forgets about natural market cycles and looks to the fed as some sort of God. In bear markets everyone realizes they had no divine power to stop the natural market cycle of a bear market and the study of cycles becomes extremely populr again. This is the cycle of sentiment and social mood and is the only reason why people are giving the fed so much credit. They follow natural market cycles and can only exacerbate them not control them. We have ended the 39 year cycle of decreasing rates and now are in the increasing cycle. They will follow that natural cycle. \\n\\nAs far as interest rates and inflation, that is the story that is repeated over and over when you turn on the news and is a total distraction. It’s like a slight of hand, look over here at interest rates everybody so you don’t investigate the true causes. Deflation is what tempers inflation not interest rate cycles. When money/credit is expanded drastically and causes inflation, the only thing that will counter that is money contraction, like has been happening with central banks reducing their bond buying and instead selling, and will equities, crypto, etc selling off. All of that selling causes massive devaluing of the assets and is deflationary. Interest rates are just a side show that keep people distracted. \\n\\nJust watch “the princes of the yen” which shows how the central bank in Japan dictated massive credit expansion through its “window guidance” and lent aggressively to consumers to fuel the real estate and stock bubbles for the purpose of engineering a crash. That housing and stock inflation was entirely engineered by credit expansion and interest rates weren’t even a fart in the wind. \\n\\nOr look back the past decades when interest rates were up at 10% or higher. Did that stop stocks or housing form inflating? Nope. We had massive asset inflation when rates were much higher than they are now, except now when they have been at all time lows, what are we experiencing? Deflation. Just watch as crypto has imploded and stocks are in the middle of a massive devaluing and do they fucking care what the interest rate is? If so then why at such low interest rates are assets deflating when they were 10% assets inflated? Explain that one? \\n\\nIt’s a side show and a distraction and a false causality.

This is the cycle of sentiment and social mood and is the only reason why people are giving the fed so much credit. They follow natural market cycles and can only exacerbate them not control them. We have ended the 39 year cycle of decreasing rates and now are in the increasing cycle. They will follow that natural cycle. \\n\\nAs far as interest rates and inflation, that is the story that is repeated over and over when you turn on the news and is a total distraction. It’s like a slight of hand, look over here at interest rates everybody so you don’t investigate the true causes. Deflation is what tempers inflation not interest rate cycles. When money/credit is expanded drastically and causes inflation, the only thing that will counter that is money contraction, like has been happening with central banks reducing their bond buying and instead selling, and will equities, crypto, etc selling off. All of that selling causes massive devaluing of the assets and is deflationary. Interest rates are just a side show that keep people distracted. \\n\\nJust watch “the princes of the yen” which shows how the central bank in Japan dictated massive credit expansion through its “window guidance” and lent aggressively to consumers to fuel the real estate and stock bubbles for the purpose of engineering a crash. That housing and stock inflation was entirely engineered by credit expansion and interest rates weren’t even a fart in the wind. \\n\\nOr look back the past decades when interest rates were up at 10% or higher. Did that stop stocks or housing form inflating? Nope. We had massive asset inflation when rates were much higher than they are now, except now when they have been at all time lows, what are we experiencing? Deflation. Just watch as crypto has imploded and stocks are in the middle of a massive devaluing and do they fucking care what the interest rate is? If so then why at such low interest rates are assets deflating when they were 10% assets inflated? Explain that one? \\n\\nIt’s a side show and a distraction and a false causality. Pretty much anything you click the news on and get as an explanation of causality you can reverse.\"]},\"created_at\":\"2022-10-07T18:04:41.360976Z\",\"editable_until\":\"2022-10-07T18:19:41.360976Z\",\"likes_count\":1,\"user_vote\":0,\"user\":{\"id\":936021,\"avatars\":{\"small\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/936021-GUf9.png\",\"mid\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/936021-GUf9_mid.png\",\"big\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/936021-GUf9_big.png\",\"orig\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/936021-GUf9_orig.png\"},\"username\":\"wealthprophet\",\"is_broker\":false,\"is_pro\":true,\"is_paid_pro\":true,\"pro_plan\":\"pro_premium\",\"broker_plan\":null,\"is_moderator\":false,\"is_trial\":false,\"badges\":[{\"name\":\"pro:pro_premium\",\"verbose_name\":\"Premium\"}],\"is_online\":false},\"spam_status\":null,\"is_hidden\":false,\"depth\":3,\"platform\":null,\"platform_link_url\":null,\"platform_link_text\":null,\"coins\":null},{\"id\":9276756,\"parent_id\":9276723,\"root_id\":9272796,\"comment\":\"@wealthprophet, Ok I will definitely watch that documentary.

How come same principle doesn't apply to everything else or maybe this is a big strategy out there that no one talks about.\"]},\"created_at\":\"2022-10-06T21:08:03.088954Z\",\"editable_until\":\"2022-10-06T21:23:03.088954Z\",\"likes_count\":1,\"user_vote\":0,\"user\":{\"id\":25519279,\"avatars\":{\"small\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%2239%22%20height=%2239%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%28150,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3EJ%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"mid\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%2296%22%20height=%2296%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%28150,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3EJ%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"big\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%22320%22%20height=%22320%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%28150,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3EJ%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"orig\":null},\"username\":\"Jamsie1\",\"is_broker\":false,\"is_pro\":true,\"is_paid_pro\":true,\"pro_plan\":\"pro_realtime\",\"broker_plan\":null,\"is_moderator\":false,\"is_trial\":false,\"badges\":[{\"name\":\"pro:pro_realtime\",\"verbose_name\":\"Pro+\"}],\"is_online\":false},\"spam_status\":null,\"is_hidden\":false,\"depth\":2,\"platform\":null,\"platform_link_url\":null,\"platform_link_text\":null,\"coins\":null},{\"id\":9273932,\"parent_id\":9273144,\"root_id\":9273061,\"comment\":\"@SPY_Master, Well said!

setups playing out to perfection once again!!!!! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs advised yesterday we were planning our entries to catch the movement up from support levels and that's exactly what we did with a trailed TP to 1682. Our swing range was once again charted to perfection with the perfect swing. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe chart levels are still valid and re-open, as we are still within the structure range, and therefore we can continue to track and trade the movement with EMA5 cross and lock both ways. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">BULLISH</span></a>  TARGETS <br/>\r\n1697 <br/>\r\n1709 <br/>\r\n1725 <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK ABOVE 1725 WILL OPEN 1734 AND 1742 <br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">BEARISH</span></a>  TARGETS <br/>\r\n1687 - DONE <br/>\r\n1676 - DONE <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEMA5 CROSS AND LOCK BELOW 1687 WILL OPEN 1676 - (DONE) AND 1660 <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSWING RANGE <br/>\r\n1660 <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSUPPORT STRUCTURE <br/>\r\n1620 <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs always, we will keep you all updated with regular updates throughout the week and how we manage the setups.

In the big scheme of things, not much has changed. Merely the market confirmed our  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  bias, which we have continued to nourish throughout 2022.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDespite many calling it the spreading of fear and uncertainty, we can not ignore macroeconomic factors driving the market. Because of that, we continue to think that the bear market is not done. Quite the contrary, we believe the market conditions are set to dramatically worsen with the FED rising interest rates later next month. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn tandem with that assessment, we think the market is due to start slowly progressing from the second stage of the bear market into the third stage in 2023 (after weak  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">earnings</span></a>  reinforce our notion of the 2nd stage of the bear market). Therefore, we believe that the market has not hit bottom yet. Accordingly, we stick to our price target of 3500 USD.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Illustration 1.01</em> <br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ro1555DY\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ro1555DY\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n\t\tIllustration 1.01 shows the hourly chart of  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"CME_MINI:ES1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/CME_MINI-ES1!/\"><span>ES1!</span> </a></span>  continuous  <a href=\"/ideas/commodities/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">futures</span></a> .
