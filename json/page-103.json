At the end of the week , Price may get support from the same dynamic line but still we didn't get confirmation whether it will continue the trend or it is a reversal? <br/>\r\nThat visibility is available in daily TF. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDaily TF : <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAfter knowing from the higher TF (Weekly), we get a initial idea how's  the price was reacted from dynamic  <a href=\"/ideas/trendline/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">trend line</span></a>  and also it is making  <a href=\"/ideas/fallingwedge/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">falling wedge</span></a>  with structure of LH -LL. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are two possibility we can get over here : <br/>\n<br/>\r\n1.

(P -2) <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Conclusion , My observation still at the down side because there is no clear direction of structure breakout or change  in price-action  that supports any  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  price action. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBuyers can wait till price comes at  <a href=\"/ideas/demandzone/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">demand zone</span></a>  or  you can follow the price action. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSellers can get opportunity when price reject from above mention levels and clear confirmation in terms of the  <a href=\"/ideas/volume/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volume</span></a>  and momentum.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf you have a different opinion, please share your thoughts in the comment section.

Additionally, we expressed our  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  views on it over the coming months, set price targets at 0.30 USD (medium-term) and 0.28 USD (long-term), and presented a conservative setup with two possible scenarios.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSince then, the price of XRPUSD has shot to the upside through the short-term resistance, which is a  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  development we previously outlined. Typically, such price action would invalidate our price targets on the downside for the short-term price target. However, fundamental factors (increasing interest rates and economic tightening) driving the primary trend have not changed, which allows us to stick to our price targets.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIndeed, the abrupt move accompanied news that came out regarding the legal case between RippleLab and the SEC. It took merely a few hours, and we are already noticing a wall of  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  posts forecasting the reversal of the primary trend and the beginning of a new  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a>  era. However, we have little faith in this thesis because of the slowing global economy and growing geopolitical problems coupled with risk aversion. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe acknowledge that thin  <a href=\"/ideas/volume/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volume</span></a>  can lead to a higher price in the short term. However, we think the rally will not sustain in the medium and long term. Furthermore, we believe the recent price action is just a short-lived hype like in the case of other cryptocurrencies that already underwent breakouts to the upside (which were dampened in XRP) from a wide range (in July and August).  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs for the short-term, we do not know how much higher XRPUSD can go. However, we are already seeing several warning signs. Because of that, we will pay close attention to  <a href=\"/ideas/volume/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volume</span></a>  and price action.
