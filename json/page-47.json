[{"title": "What Does This Say About the Future?", "name": "SPY_Master", "time": "", "link": "/chart/OXY/gGPdVIdA-What-Does-This-Say-About-the-Future/", "contents": ["<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">As many of you know, this week Warren Buffet increased his stake in the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYMEX:CL1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYMEX-CL1!/\"><span>oil</span> </a></span>  and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"OANDA:NATGASUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/OANDA-NATGASUSD/\"><span>natural gas</span> </a></span>  company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY). <br/>\r\nWarren Buffett’s holding company  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BMV:BRKB\"><a href=\"/symbols/BMV-BRKB/\"><span>Berkshire Hathaway</span> </a></span>  now owns about 21% of the company.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn light of Warren Buffet's purchase, I analyzed the chart of OXY to see what he or his analysts might be seeing. As I'll explain below, what I found was concerning for multiple reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis is the yearly chart of the entire price history of OXY. Each candle represents the price action for one year. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/DKpg3C5u\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/DKpg3C5u\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nIt is important to log-adjust your charts in general, but especially when analyzing higher timeframes. Below is a log-adjusted chart.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/3LLn6mYi\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/3LLn6mYi\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nSince OXY is also a dividend-paying stock, analyzing its history over such a long time period over which it has paid dividends means we need to adjust for dividends as well. Below is a dividend-adjusted chart. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/70zEmgtz\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/70zEmgtz\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nNow that the chart has been properly adjusted, we can do our chart analysis.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLooking at this chart, I immediately noticed that OXY is about to undergo a major  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciextension/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci extension</span></a> . I will explain more below.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFirst, I applied Fibonacci levels from the lowest low to the highest high. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/A7OkyMxq\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/A7OkyMxq\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/lovqhYFF\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/lovqhYFF\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nYou can see my Fibonacci levels applied in the chart above (I hid the 0.5 level because that is actually not a Fibonacci level). <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI noticed that, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, OXY's price bounced off of the golden ratio and then proceed to move much higher. See the below chart. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/BxF2ocyr\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/BxF2ocyr\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nIn my experience, this type of price action is rare and usually proceeds what is called an \"S-curve jump\". Without getting too deep into higher-level mathematics behind S curves, in short, an S-curve jump basically means a major breakout may occur on the time frame in which it appears.  Following an S-curve jump, prices can move much higher.  Since this particular jump is occurring on a high timeframe, be mindful that the move can seem slow, and there can even be periods of weeks or months of declines even though a breakout on the yearly timeframe is underway.   Perhaps this is why Warren Buffet accumulated so many shares of this company.  Warren Buffet is long-term investor and so investing based on the yearly chart is most consistent with a multi-decadal investment strategy like his. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo help you visualize what an S-curve jump looks like I've illustrated it below. This chart is purely illustrative and is not my actual price projection for OXY (it's impossible to accurately predict price so far into the future). <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/LUdXhvfr\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/LUdXhvfr\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nAs shown above, price jumps from one S-curve to another, leading to significant increases in price.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nInterestingly, the second S-curve often starts at the golden ratio retracement of the previous S-curve. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/bvDKK2St\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/bvDKK2St\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nOnce the price successfully jumps an S-curve, the price increases can be monumental.  Actually, it is during the period after price jumps an S-curve that most people get wealthy from their investment.  It's how 'millionaires are created'.  However, price tends to falter at each successive  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciextension/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci extension</span></a> . Below I've highlighted an example of this using  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:BTCUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/BTCUSD/\"><span>Bitcoin</span> </a></span>  which moves almost entirely based on Fibonacci extensions and retracements. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/C6r9fZjc\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/C6r9fZjc\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nNotice how following a perfect golden ratio retracement,  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:BTCUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/BTCUSD/\"><span>Bitcoin</span> </a></span>  moved up to nearly the next  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciextension/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci extension</span></a>  level before collapsing back down a Fibonacci level. You can see clearly that price has been hovering right on a Fibonacci level in recent months.   <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGoing back to OXY, we can use a regression channel to try to validate the hypothesis that price may move much higher in the coming year(s). See the chart below. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/OTSASowO\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/OTSASowO\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nA regression channel merely measures how far above or below its mean an asset is currently priced.  Each blue line represents a standard deviation from the mean.  We can see that OXY's price recently reached its mean (the red line) before retracing back down.  Similar to retracement after reaching Fibonacci extensions, it is common for price to retrace some of its move each time it hits a higher standard deviation. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhat's noteworthy is that although OXY's price has come all the way back up near its  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:ALL-AMEX:TIME\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-ALL/\"><span>all-time</span> </a></span>  high, the regression channel shows that this level is now merely the price's mean. See the below chart. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/5V95sn0i\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/5V95sn0i\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nThis suggests that, from a mean regression perspective, OXY's price can rise much higher before becoming as overextended as it was the last time it was priced at this level. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIf we conclude that OXY's price is poised to go much higher, what does this say about the future?  What might spiraling energy prices say about the Federal Reserve's, and other central banks', ability to fight inflation?  By buying OXY while the Fed is trying to fight  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a> , is Warren Buffet fighting the Fed? What might higher energy prices say about supply issues in the long term?  Might higher energy prices reflect a prolonged period of deglobalization, or perhaps, something worse like geopolitical conflict?  What might the consequences of higher energy prices be for climate change?  Will higher energy prices incentive more investment in alternative energy options like solar, wind, nuclear and hydrogen?   <br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne thing is for certain: The  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"MYX:SCOPE\"><a href=\"/symbols/MYX-SCOPE/\"><span>scope</span> </a></span>  of monetary easing that we saw over the past couple of decades is unprecedented in history, and it has created an asset bubble that is unfathomable. I will leave you with two additional charts. One shows how low U.S. GDP growth has been over the past couple of decades, and yet how high its stock market has climbed due to monetary easing.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/XYlMRZ2z\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/XYlMRZ2z\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z0XR1Oof\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/Z0XR1Oof\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>How do you soft land a stock market that's risen into the stratosphere?

That's because stock market bottoms are predetermined by past price action. In the case of  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"SP:SPX\"><a href=\"/symbols/SPX/\"><span>SPX</span> </a></span> , the next stock market bottom was predetermined nearly 90 years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI will try to prove this below using the replay function that <a href=\"/u/TradingView/\" target=\"_blank\">@TradingView</a> provides for charts.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo let's go back in time. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere is what the stock market looked like in 1929 right after the <em><strong>Black Tuesday</strong></em> stock market crash.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/6C6zeYBG\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/6C6zeYBG\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nAround this time, market participants felt not much unlike they feel today: The stock market had been on a decade-long rip higher but just had a bad past several months. For the most part, most of the profits from a decade of prolific growth were intact. Though fear was high and continuing to mount, many market participants still had hope that the stock market would recover and continue its trend higher in the next year. Little did they know that they were sitting on the precipice of the most dramatic crash in stock market history... <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo see what happened let's apply Fibonacci levels. See the chart below where I placed log-adjusted Fibonacci levels. (<em>One should always use log-adjusted Fibonacci levels when analyzing the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"TVC:SPX\"><a href=\"/symbols/SPX/\"><span>S&amp;P 500</span> </a></span>  in general, but especially on higher timeframes</em>). <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/LgxgTk81\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/LgxgTk81\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUnfortunately, the stock market would proceed to crash relentlessly for years. Here's what the chart looked like precisely at the stock market bottom in 1931. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Vtxmdw3\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/0Vtxmdw3\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nThe magnitude of the market crash is hard to overstate. Indeed, many people's lives were ruined by it. Some investors who lost everything even committed suicide. At this point, virtually all market participants were certain the stock market would never go back up to new  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:ALL-AMEX:TIME\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-ALL/\"><span>all-time</span> </a></span>  highs. But it's usually precisely at these points of universal despair that significant stock market bottoms form.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDespite all the calamity and then despair, the stock market was merely undergoing  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciretracement/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci retracement</span></a>  on the yearly timeframe. As you can see below, it retraced, and then quickly rebounded. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/6tFO8N60\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/6tFO8N60\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow let's fast forward over a half-century to the what's often considered the second-worst stock market crash in history: the infamous <strong><em>Black Monday</em></strong> on October 19, 1987.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nTo put this date into perspective I've drawn a line up to this level on the 1931 chart. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/IuUjow61\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/IuUjow61\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nLet's fill in all the candles to see what happened on Black Monday in 1987.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs you can see in the chart below, during the 1980s, after Fed chairman Volcker successfully contained the  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">inflation</span></a>  of the 1970s, the stock market ripped higher.  <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/rC2pwgYK\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/rC2pwgYK\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nHowever, unbeknownst to many, the stock market was beginning to approach its 2nd  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciextension/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci extension</span></a>  (or 2nd Fibonacci spiral). These important Fibonacci levels act as magnets to which price is mathematically attracted. As market participants' greed and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITKUB:OPTHB\"><a href=\"/symbols/OPTHB/\"><span>optimism</span> </a></span>  took hold, the stock market went up parabolically.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEveryone was getting rich.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDerivatives trading exploded because of market participants' extreme greed. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThen, in August 1987, the 2nd  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciextension/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci extension</span></a>  was reached. <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/KTAcAuTr\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/KTAcAuTr\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nHere's a close-up: <br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ymnRr5Ox\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/ymnRr5Ox\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\r\nAfter August 1987, the stock market entered a typically volatile period of the year (September and October). Suddenly, everyone's greed shifted to panic.  Everyone wanted to sell all at once.  Derivatives trading became chaotic, so much so that the  <a href=\"/ideas/volume/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volume</span></a>  overwhelmed the exchanges to such an extreme level that price discovery became virtually impossible.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe stock market crashed.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt caused the highest  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">volatility</span></a>  spike ever recorded. The predecessor to the  <a href=\"/ideas/vx1!/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">VIX</span></a> , the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"CBOE:VXO\"><a href=\"/symbols/CBOE-VXO/\"><span>VXO</span> </a></span> , reached an intraday high of 172.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe  <a href=\"/ideas/vx1!/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">VIX</span></a>  today is 28. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe second-worst stock market crash in history following the Great Depression happened exactly at the second  <a href=\"/ideas/fibonacciextension/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Fibonacci extension</span></a> . <br/>\n<br/>\n<div class=\"tv-embeded-image\">\n<a class=\"js-embeded-image\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/0dfHVXQP\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt=\"snapshot\" class=\"js-image-lazy-load\" data-src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/0dfHVXQP\" src=\"https://static.tradingview.com/static/images/svg/idea-image-placeholder.svg\"/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<br/>\r\nNow let's fast forward to the year 2000. Dotcom stocks were ballooning as market participants began to realize that an e-commerce revolution was happening. Again, market participants' greed and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITKUB:OPTHB\"><a href=\"/symbols/OPTHB/\"><span>optimism</span> </a></span>  took hold, the stock market went up parabolically.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEveryone was getting rich.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut remember the chart from the Great Depression?

The yearly chart will tend to want to close near this level. This means that more downside is likely from late September into October, and then price will rise in November and into December to close the year near this Fibonacci level or slightly below or above it. In terms of how low price can drop in 2022 before finding some kind of strong support, keep an eye out for 3566 on the S&amp;P 500. I would be quite surprised if price crashes below this level with no bounce at all. This level is a golden ratio retracement from the COVID bottom to the January 2022 top. If price respects this level strongly, then there is a bull case to be made going into the close of the year. Whereas if price crashes past this level, then I would be quite concerned. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt is my belief that if the S&amp;P 500 does not find its ultimate bottom around 3566, then it will be quite clear that the stock market has begun a years-long process of retracing stock market gains. As always, anything can happen, and there will surely be bull runs along the way. This is not financial advice, do your own research. Don't use anything I post to buy or sell.

Throughout stock market history things often feel this way. Volatility is common almost every September and October. Indeed the current VIX level is actually quite low compared to periods of worse stock market panic. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile I do see further economic downturn in the future, there are nonetheless great opportunities to invest in beaten-down stocks right now! I am currently loading up on beaten-down stock in my self-directed IRA, which has a time horizon of about 30 years before I start to cash out. In this account, I only ever buy. I never sell stocks from it. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHere are some crashing stocks that look like great long-term investment candidates to dollar-cost average on within an IRA: <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSWK <br/>\r\nVFC <br/>\r\nSMG <br/>\r\nMPW <br/>\r\nWPC <br/>\r\nCHTR <br/>\r\nFDX <br/>\r\nO <br/>\r\nFIS <br/>\n<br/>\r\nCould these all go lower? Yes, absolutely. In which case, buy more! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou may ask, but what if some of these companies go bust?! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMy answer: That's fine. Investing is not about being perfect, it's about having probability on your side. All you need is for just a few of these stocks to simply recover their losses and the rest can go bankrupt and you'd still be profitable. Most likely, all of these companies will persist and over 10, 20, or 30 or more years, many of them will rise by multiples of where they're trading today. I screened these companies to confirm that they all outperform the money supply over time. So once the Fed does pivot (and it will) and restarts the money printer, these stocks will scream higher. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nFinally, you may ask: Why buy now and not later at a cheaper price? <br/>\n<br/>\r\nMy answer: Well while things can get cheaper, but they also might not. No one ever knows the exact bottom. For a stock like SMG, it has already dropped to a level that has a significant economic downturn priced in. In fact, SMG's drop is equivalent to the S&amp;P 500's drop during the Great Depression on a standard deviation basis. Knowing this makes it a perfect candidate for an IRA. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou should always contribute the maximum to an IRA regardless of if you expect the market to get cheaper. This is because, if the market does get cheaper, you will have a large basket of holdings that you can convert to Roth, and then benefit from tax-free growth. Waiting until the market bottom, assuming one can even predict the exact bottom, is not ideal because you can only contribute a certain amount to an IRA in a given year. Thus, you will not benefit as much from buying right at the bottom, as you would averaging down and accumulating a much larger portfolio and then converting to a Roth at the bottom. The only strategy that is time-tested is dollar cost-averaging for an IRA. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo the moral of the story is that during market crashes there is much opportunity to build wealth, and one of the best means to do so is an IRA. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNot financial advice, just my thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/s/SfRcNhtc_big.png", "comments": "[{\"id\":9192624,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9192624,\"comment\":\"Great stuff.

During this late phase of an asset’s growth, one of three things can occur: \\n\\n(1) The price of an asset continues to stagnate endlessly (meaning it increases by lesser and lesser amounts over time as it perpetually nears its asymptote); \\n\\n(2) The price of an asset begins to decline substantially as the function converts to exponential decay (Typically, if the stock of a company undergoes this type of event the company will proceed to bankruptcy and eventually be delisted. The only stocks that I have ever seen undergo this conversion and yet still be listed on the stock exchanges are those of banks, and that is because the Federal Reserve prefers to keep banks in existence regardless of their growth potential in an attempt to maintain the stability of the banking system); or \\n\\n(3) The price of an asset “jumps” to the next S-curve (Jumping to the next S-curve is the most bullish scenario and can happen once despair shifts back to mania.  There are some interesting articles about what fundamentally causes this, but you can tell when this is about to occur using charts. Right before the “jump” occurs, price forms a bull flag or pennant on the log scale with the MA exp ribbon supporting price.

The Fed can't pivot or else inflation will spiral.  \\n\\nHere's the situation in the UK right now: After decades of monetary easing -- to such an extreme degree that the amount of assets on the Bank of England's balance sheet is the highest in the 322-year period for which records exist -- inflation is now spiraling out of control. Inflation has reached the highest levels in 40 years. Despite the highest inflation in over a generation, the UK has chosen now, of all possible times, to cut taxes.  Cutting taxes during spiraling inflation is sort of like trying to blow out a fire.  The fire gets worse.  With lower taxes, people now have more money to spend, which keeps inflation higher for longer.  As a result, the UK's bond yields rose because following the tax cuts, the market anticipated more hiking would be needed to quell inflation.  Rather than actually hike rates more, the Bank of England chose to buy bonds to bring yields back down.  This is like trying to drown out a fire by dousing it with gasoline.  Since banks and credit markets typically peg their lending rates to these yields, this monetary easing action incentivizes cheaper credit.  By incentivizing cheaper credit, more money is created through lending, more money in the system will in turn cause inflation to spiral yet even higher.  In fact, most money is created through lending.  This in turn creates a negative feedback loop whereby the U.S. Federal Reserve cannot pivot to easing because inflation continues to worse. It causes the Fed to hike more for longer.  This in turn puts yet even more pressure on Japan, the UK, and the rest of the world's currencies, and in turn, they may continue to ease yet even more. In a worst-case scenario, hyperinflation may occur. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the least developed countries will experience shortages of food and commodities as these become unattainable due to high inflation. These countries do not possess the reserves needed to counter a strengthening dollar, like Japan and the UK.\\n\\nAfter seeing the Bank of England and Bank of Japan both respond to high inflation with more monetary easing, I am increasingly convinced that this situation is going to spiral into a full-blown monetary crisis. \\n\\nIndeed, this is the dollar milkshake theory that Brent Johnson has been warning would come for years: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxzy3sLs4Bs\",\"comment_ast\":{\"type\":\"root\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"user\",\"params\":{\"name\":\"akikostas\",\"link\":\"/u/akikostas/\"}},\",  Central banks are totally trapped.  The Fed can't pivot or else inflation will spiral.  \\n\\nHere's the situation in the UK right now: After decades of monetary easing -- to such an extreme degree that the amount of assets on the Bank of England's balance sheet is the highest in the 322-year period for which records exist -- inflation is now spiraling out of control. Inflation has reached the highest levels in 40 years. Despite the highest inflation in over a generation, the UK has chosen now, of all possible times, to cut taxes.  Cutting taxes during spiraling inflation is sort of like trying to blow out a fire.  The fire gets worse.  With lower taxes, people now have more money to spend, which keeps inflation higher for longer.

Because as of now, there is still no reason to believe that  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:BTCUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/BTCUSD/\"><span>BTC</span> </a></span>  will do so, only because it has pumped now already 6 months earlier than 4 years ago. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis could just mean that we also reach the peak 6 months earlier. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe fundamental price drivers will remain the halvings and mainstream adoption. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWe can also clearly see that the factors between the subsequent peaks is diminishing every time. <br/>\r\nFrom x38 to x16 and now probably to around x6 and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nIt cannot just continue to do the same increases again and again, then we would have prices of 100 million USD by 2025 or some insane stuff like that. <br/>\r\nThat is not very scientific but sensationalist, and we should remain realistic here, even if that means being more conservative. Conservative with 1.3 million in 2030 LOL. <br/>\r\nTry telling that someone in the stockmarket hehehe! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nAnyways, there is indeed the chance that  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:BTCUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/BTCUSD/\"><span>BTC</span> </a></span>  leaves this channel and creates a faster rising one, but the future datapoints are not here yet, so we must use <br/>\r\nthe past points for extrapolation. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBut no matter what happens, I am convinced that  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BITSTAMP:BTCUSD\"><a href=\"/symbols/BTCUSD/\"><span>BTC</span> </a></span>  mainstream adoption WILL happen.

I decided the rest of the morning looking through the historical relationship of these two EMAs. It turns out that each time the 21EMA has come down to the 89EMA, there has been a violent reaction. In general, when there are moderate to minimal macros effecting the markets, this reaction represents a strong opportunity to long. In fact, the 21EMA has never dipped below the 89EMA and  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COVID19:RECOVERED\"><a href=\"/symbols/COVID19-RECOVERED/\"><span>recovered</span> </a></span>  until months to years later. On the flip side, on the two occasions the 21EMA did dip below the 89EMA, was in 2001 and 2008...two very significant moments in market history. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI also noted that once the break happens the  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"FX:SPX500\"><a href=\"/symbols/FX-SPX500/\"><span>S&amp;P</span> </a></span>  tends to bottom at around 40%-50% of that breaking point. If we were to use today's valuation, a 45% drop from today  is around 2200. That is also the bottom of the COVID crash i.e. where the real market was going to be trading before infinite stimulus was provided by the Fed. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nI found this interesting as it seems in these troubling times and with a 'nuclear winter' around the corner in Europe, there is a real macro concern for markets. I'm leaning  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  and I think this rally will fail like every rally this year and lead the 21EMA below the 89EMA. Obviously, I react to the chart and should there be a strong reaction off the touch upwards, I will be flipping  <a href=\"/ideas/bullish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bullish</span></a> .\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">\n<span class=\"tv-chart-updates__label tv-chart-updates__label--active\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrade active:\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bears are out in force and the 21EMA has already started to drop below the 89EMA. This price action going into Q4 is extremely bearish. Winter in Europe is forecasted to be a tough one, to put it mildly, and the markets are preparing for a recession. The CPI figures leave the FED with no option but to keep hiking rates and frankly, the populace has accepted we are in for a tough time. Now is the time for the FED to be aggressive in tackling inflation. The quicker we get into a recession, the quicker we can adjust to get back out of it. The longer we delay, the more likely a depression / stagflation event occurs.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe next two weeks will determine price action for the foreseeable future. Successive weeks of the 21EMA below the 89EMA, going into end of week, month  and quarter  is a very bearish indication.  <br/>\n<br/>\r\nStay safe.\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">\n<span class=\"tv-chart-updates__label tv-chart-updates__label--\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComment:\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a sellers market. 21 EMA has dropped below the 89EMA convincingly. Furthermore, the price has dropped below the 200EMA. This, again, is extremely bearish PA. A reclaim by end of the week is needed by the bulls to save the day. If not, historically, a 40% drop is probable.\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "<div class=\"tv-chart-view__description selectable\">\n<span class=\"tv-chart-updates__label tv-chart-updates__label--active\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrade active:\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tQ3 closed with yearly lows. This weekly/monthly/quarterly couldnt be more bearish 🐻. Not only has the 21EMA crossed the 89EMA on the weekly but the price rejected off the 200EMA. The last time this happened was in March 2008 prior to a 48% drop.  <br/>\r\nThere will probably be rallies in the coming weeks to try and reclaim the 200EMA so there is upside potential but the trend is your friend in these conditions. Outlook remains bearish and this is a sellers market. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nHikes will continue into 2023 as Powell mentioned, the US posted a 3rd consecutive quarter with negative GDP growth, Russia annexing 4 Ukrainian regions + they're Nato application on top of a very very cold and expensive winter for our European cousins.

June #15) before it made it’s August peak. As discussed before, when  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  Trades within that zone, in most cases according to the cycle, Price-action always delivers Medium-term Selling opportunity on the aftermath. I have mentioned that current relief rally will be short-lived and that  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  will deliver decent Medium-term Selling opportunity towards #1,600.80 psychological mark once again. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Technical analysis:</strong> On a Short-term perspective and regarding the  <a href=\"/ideas/daily/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Daily chart</span></a> , there is an interesting development with the  <a href=\"/ideas/relativestrengthindex/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">RSI</span></a>  indicator on a  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Bearish</span></a>  Divergence (BD) with the Price-action as it is on Lower High's Upper zone since September #26, while the Price-action is on Higher Low's Upper zone at the moment. Similar sequence has happened both from January #11 - #16 and February #16 - #20. Both led to a #3-session peak above the Hourly 4 chart's Resistance in form of the recovery, then Selling opportunity has been delivered. Hourly 4 chart’s Resistance is currently seen Trading at #1,682.80 on Spot prices. If that’s the case, today’s E.U. session will be followed with thin  <a href=\"/ideas/volume/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Volume</span></a> , and as U.S. session is approaching with more  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Volatility</span></a>  / consolidation, I can expect Sellers to re-appear and push  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  as Low as they can, following the positive  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:DX\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-DX/\"><span>DX</span> </a></span>  sentiment due NFP not missing the estimate.(on main stage tomorrow). I will exercise caution since market structure is tight today and tomorrow, while my Medium-term Selling orders (above #1,700.80) are looking great at this point. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fundamental analysis:</strong> Important Trading Week for  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  ahead as the traditional  <a href=\"/ideas/volatility/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Volatility</span></a>  is visible on the markets (for more than #14 sessions  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"OTC:SHCAY\"><a href=\"/symbols/OTC-SHCAY/\"><span>sharp</span> </a></span> ) as Fed (doing the same manoeuvre continously to postpone, but not to prevent the final crash) is deal with Repurchase agreements scheme and inventing such thing as “Federal Debt ceiling”, as discussed many times is traditional Fed's practise as they are about to pass another huge Bill (which will be released shortly) and their main aim is to remove the public’s attention from huge disastrous Bill they are about to pass, and shift it towards Debt ceiling issue. This is  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Inflation</span></a>  data and always keep in mind Gold's use as a counter to  <a href=\"/ideas/fundamental/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Inflation</span></a> , but with current hyperinflation growing on Daily basis, I do not see  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  as sustainable sole asset as hedge against it. From #20 - #30 sessions aspect and point of view, if chart is consulted (observing September #3 High’s and September #30 Low’s similarities from few Years back), it is obvious why the Price-action was caught in middle of multi-Month Neutral  <a href=\"/ideas/rectangle/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Rectangle</span></a> . <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>My position:</strong> <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  is Trading on my predicted values and currently the path is clear towards #1,600.80 psychological mark. Remember the importance of  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:DX\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-DX/\"><span>DX</span> </a></span>  in these sessions as I have been waiting  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:DX\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-DX/\"><span>DX</span> </a></span>  to find the Support and start recovering (to start re-Selling  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"COMEX:GC1!\"><a href=\"/symbols/COMEX-GC1!/\"><span>Gold</span> </a></span>  on Intra-day basis) as  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"NYSE:DX\"><a href=\"/symbols/NYSE-DX/\"><span>DX</span> </a></span>  determines Gold's Short and Medium-term direction. I have utilized current Selling sequence since #1,720's as I don't have aim to stop. My Medium-term Selling orders are running nicely as I have engaged additional Selling order (#1,670.80 entry point) towards #1,652.80 mark first, then #1,642.80 Support in extension. </div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/u/uYuSAOOk_big.png", "comments": "[{\"id\":9287654,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9287654,\"comment\":\"awesome forecast ser..thanks.\",\"comment_ast\":{\"type\":\"root\",\"children\":[\"awesome forecast ser..thanks.\"]},\"created_at\":\"2022-10-11T07:29:06.936684Z\",\"editable_until\":\"2022-10-11T07:44:06.936684Z\",\"likes_count\":0,\"user_vote\":0,\"user\":{\"id\":14191447,\"avatars\":{\"small\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%2239%22%20height=%2239%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%28297,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3ED%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"mid\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%2296%22%20height=%2296%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%28297,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3ED%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"big\":\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220,0,20,20%22%20width=%22320%22%20height=%22320%22%3E%3Crect%20height=%2220%22%20width=%2220%22%20fill=%22hsl%28297,25%25,50%25%29%22/%3E%3Ctext%20fill=%22white%22%20x=%2210%22%20y=%2214.8%22%20font-size=%2214%22%20font-family=%22-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,Trebuchet%20MS,Roboto,Ubuntu,sans-serif%22%20text-anchor=%22middle%22%3ED%3C/text%3E%3C/svg%3E\",\"orig\":null},\"username\":\"dneshanroid\",\"is_broker\":false,\"is_pro\":true,\"is_paid_pro\":true,\"pro_plan\":\"pro\",\"broker_plan\":null,\"is_moderator\":false,\"is_trial\":false,\"badges\":[{\"name\":\"pro:pro\",\"verbose_name\":\"Pro\"}],\"is_online\":false},\"spam_status\":null,\"is_hidden\":false,\"depth\":0,\"platform\":null,\"platform_link_url\":null,\"platform_link_text\":null,\"coins\":null},{\"id\":9287594,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9287594,\"comment\":\"Excellent post!

Briefly, I am waiting for the last  <a href=\"/ideas/bearish/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">bearish</span></a>  leg down. Before it I made the local analysis on the 1h timeframe using the Trading Chaos approach and I was quite successful. One year ago I red 3 books about the Trading Chaos and make a conclusion that its useless theory. But one month ago I decided to study this approach again and found that I was unexperienced to understand it in the correct way Now I am practicing in this approach on the local 1h timeframe because I need short-term strategy. On the 1D timeframe I am successful, but it is not sufficient for me. Today I am going to continue analyzing the local timeframe using Trading Chaos. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nLet’s take a look at the 1h timeframe  <span class=\"js-inline-quote-ticker\" data-symbol=\"BINANCE:BTCUSDT\"><a href=\"/symbols/BTCUSDT/\"><span>BTCUSDT</span> </a></span>  chart of the WhiteBit exchange. We can find here the completed 1-2-3-4-5  <a href=\"/ideas/elliottwaves/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Elliott waves</span></a>  cycle. The divergence with the  <a href=\"/ideas/awesomeoscillator/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Awesome oscillator</span></a>  confirms this idea. Today the price crossed above the Williams  <a href=\"/ideas/alligator/\"><span class=\"tv-chart-view__tag-page-link\">Alligator</span></a>  indicator’s balance (red) line, which means the market is in correction right now. The maximum target for the correction is the Fibonacci golden pocket ~ $19900 before the new crash. It looks like the bull trap is incoming because now the crowd is not disappointed and think that the market can start the bull rally in every moment. This is the signal that we have to wait a little bit more. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBest regards, Ivan</div>"], "snapshot": "https://s3.tradingview.com/u/Up9eLfxo_big.png", "comments": "[{\"id\":9289352,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9289352,\"comment\":\"Amazing analysis buddy 💎\",\"comment_ast\":{\"type\":\"root\",\"children\":[\"Amazing analysis buddy 💎\"]},\"created_at\":\"2022-10-11T16:19:28.170718Z\",\"editable_until\":\"2022-10-11T16:34:28.170718Z\",\"likes_count\":0,\"user_vote\":0,\"user\":{\"id\":9676099,\"avatars\":{\"small\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/9676099-XvzO.png\",\"mid\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/9676099-XvzO_mid.png\",\"big\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/9676099-XvzO_big.png\",\"orig\":\"https://s3.tradingview.com/userpics/9676099-XvzO_orig.png\"},\"username\":\"ShawnMCR\",\"is_broker\":false,\"is_pro\":true,\"is_paid_pro\":true,\"pro_plan\":\"pro_premium\",\"broker_plan\":null,\"is_moderator\":false,\"is_trial\":false,\"badges\":[{\"name\":\"pro:pro_premium\",\"verbose_name\":\"Premium\"}],\"is_online\":false},\"spam_status\":null,\"is_hidden\":false,\"depth\":0,\"platform\":\"ios\",\"platform_link_url\":\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1205990992?pt=118302550&ct=comments&mt=8\",\"platform_link_text\":\"TradingView for iOS\",\"coins\":null},{\"id\":9286041,\"parent_id\":null,\"root_id\":9286041,\"comment\":\"What a great idea!
